# DNDSimulator
This is my freetime project to practice multiple skills (mostly JAVA Web applications but also tasks management, SQL queries etc). 

The goal of this project is to create UI for generating Dungeons and Dragons 3.5e charactes and encounters for provided input (single/multiple enemy, challange rating,  percentage chance of encountering (or count of encountered) above average or elite creatures etc.) So it should be able to generate a new hero/boss at set level, army of 2000 orcs with 1% chance of each being above average and a leader being level 10 barbarian or just random encounter for the plains that the party is currently going trough. I have no idea when this will be finished, but I try to work on it at least 1 hour each day.

Secondary goal is to make it into actual battle simulator that will run the encounter between two sides consisting of selected parties.

If you want to contribute please feel free to comment the code or tasks for the project (check changelog, inProgress file. View other branches than master)
Everything may help the project (and me) grow :)

If you are potential recruiter feel free to use it to see my progress with skills :)
